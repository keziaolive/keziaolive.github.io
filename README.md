# About this website
Hi, this is Kezia's attempt to build her own website and have a hub for her published work.

I really like the theme that this website is built on (Jekyll Serif Theme), but I modified some of it to fit my own work (changing services into blogs, and adding publication pages, for example). 

If you're interested in using the theme, find more of the information below!

## About Jekyll Serif Theme

Serif is a modern business theme for Jekyll. It contains multiple content types for a typical brochure/marketing website. The theme is fully responsive, blazing fast and artfully illustrated.
