# About this website
Hi, this is Kezia's attempt to build her own website and have a hub for her published work.

I really like the theme that this website is built on (Jekyll Serif Theme), but I modified some of it to fit my own work (changing services into blogs, adding CV and publication pages, for example). I also used a lot of functionalities from Jekyll Scholar to organize my publication list and references.

If you're interested in using any of this, find more of the information below!

## Jekyll Serif Theme

Serif is a modern business theme for Jekyll. It contains multiple content types for a typical brochure/marketing website. The theme is fully responsive, blazing fast and artfully illustrated.
