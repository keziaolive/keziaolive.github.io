Hi, my name is Kezia Olive.
I am currently based in Helsinki, Finland, working as a Doctoral Researcher in the Faculty of Educational Sciences, [University of Helsinki](https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/persons/kezia-olive). For the past three years of my doctoral research, I have been priviliged to be funded through G-VERSITY, an [EU MSCA International Training Network](https://gversity-2020.eu/g-versity-project.html).

That is how although I am originally from Jakarta, Indonesia, and did my Master's degree in the Netherlands, I am now based in Finland and absolutely smitten by nature here -- where the geese picture up there is taken from.

I use this webpage as a hub for all my (published) work, be it related to Educational Psychology research or my personal projects.

Here is a short audio clip where I talk shortly about what my work in the past three years, as [originally posted in G-VERSITY blogpost](https://gversity-solutions.org/blog-solutions/solutions/factors-affecting-students-gendered-motivational-beliefs-in-stem/):

I love good conversations, especially if it has to do with translating numbers from my research for others, thoughts on gender equality and education, workflow and productivity, or theology -- preferably alongside good food!
(Having dogs to pet while we do that is a plus!)

You can find my [work portfolio](/publications/), [CV](/cv/), [blogposts](/blog/), and details for [contacting me](/contact/) through this webpage.

Looking forward to connecting with you!
