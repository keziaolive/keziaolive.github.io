Hi, my name is Kezia Olive.
I am currently based in Helsinki, Finland, working as a Doctoral Researcher in the Faculty of Educational Sciences, [University of Helsinki](https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/persons/kezia-olive).
I am originally from Jakarta, Indonesia, but absolutely in love with how I get to reconnect with nature after I moved first to the Netherlands, and now in Finland -- which is where the picture up there is taken from.

I use this webpage as a hub for all my (published) work, be it related to Educational Psychology research or my personal projects.
You can find my CV, work portfolio, and contact me through this webpage.

I love good conversations, especially if it has to do with translating numbers from my research for others, thoughts on gender equality and education, workflow and productivity, or theology -- preferably alongside good food!
(Having dogs to pet while we do that is a plus!)

Looking forward to connecting with you!
