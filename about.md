Hi, my name is Kezia Olive.
I am currently based in Helsinki, Finland, working as a Doctoral Researcher in the Faculty of Educational Sciences, [University of Helsinki](https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/persons/kezia-olive).

I use this webpage as a hub for all my (published) work, be it related to Educational Psychology research or my personal projects.
You can find my CV (see below), work portfolio, and contact me through this webpage.

I love good conversations, especially if it has to do with translating numbers from my research for others, workflow, theology -- preferably alongside good food!
(Having dogs to pet while we do that is a plus!)
So if you check all those boxes, looking forward to connecting with you!
