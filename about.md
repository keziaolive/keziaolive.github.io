Hi, my name is Kezia Olive.

I am currently based in Helsinki, Finland, working as a Doctoral Researcher, in [Mind's Hub research group](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/motivation-learning-and-well-being-in-digital-era) within the Faculty of Educational Sciences, [University of Helsinki](https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/persons/kezia-olive). I am currently supervised by [Academy Research Fellow Junlin Yu](https://sites.google.com/view/junlinyu/home) and [Dr. Katja Upadyaya](https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/persons/katja-natale). I am grateful to have been supervised by the late Professor [Katariina Salmela-Aro](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1901-4712) who passed away on the [26th of June 2025](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/faculty-educational-sciences/news-archive/memoriam-academy-professor-katariina-salmela-aro-1961-2025).

For the first three years of my doctoral research, I have been priviliged to be funded through G-VERSITY, an [EU MSCA International Training Network](https://gversity-2020.eu/g-versity-project.html).

Which is why, although I am originally from Jakarta (Indonesia) and did my Master's degree in Groningen (the Netherlands), I am now based in Helsinki (Finland) and absolutely smitten by nature here -- where the geese picture up there is taken from.

I use this webpage as a hub for all my (published) work, be it related to Educational Psychology research or my personal projects.

Here is a short audio clip where I talk shortly about the themes of my dissertation work has been, as [originally posted in G-VERSITY blogpost](https://gversity-solutions.org/blog-solutions/solutions/factors-affecting-students-gendered-motivational-beliefs-in-stem/):

I love good conversations, especially if it has to do with translating numbers from my research for others, thoughts on gender equality and education, workflow and productivity, or theology -- preferably alongside good food!
(Having dogs to pet while we do that is a plus!)

You can find my [work portfolio](/publications/), [CV](/cv/), [blogposts](/blog/), and details for [contacting me](/contact/) through this webpage.

Looking forward to connecting with you!
